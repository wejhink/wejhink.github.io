                        Entrepreneurs have ideas and dreams to develop an App, a platform or a marketplace or an exciting new product. Entrepreneurs need a companion to help assist in transforming it to a MVP and then take to the market. You need to have your north star or pole star, your destination and route map. You have got lot of uncertainties, doubts, questions, loose ends and missing links. Who exactly is your customer? What do they want? What are their alternatives? What's the business model? what is the revenue model? who are my competitors and what stage are they in? Does my idea is unique? What is my value proposition.
